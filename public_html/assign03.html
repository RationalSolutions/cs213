        <h3>Family Time and Slaying Dragons</h3>
        <p>
            One of the things that I end up talking about when I am not busy working as a <i>Software
            QA/QE Engineer</i> or doing homework for one of my <a href="#schoolschedule"
                                                                  title="School Schedule">classes</a>
            is usually <b>Dungeons & Dragons</b>. Prior to 2016 I only knew about it from proximity in the nerd/geek
            culture,
            at that time my youngest child was turning 3 and I was starting to feel that my children were becoming
            zombies to electronics and were lacking in imagination
            and problem solving skills. I was inspired when I read <a
                href="https://lifehacker.com/the-surprising-benefits-of-role-playing-games-and-how-1684582789"
                target="_blank" title="The Surprising Benefits of Role-Playing Games (and How to Get Started)">this
            article</a> from <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com" target="_blank" title="LifeHacker.com">www.lifehacker.com</a>
            and all the concerns that I was having were answered by the various aspects of this article. From there I
            started going to my local game store so that I could learn how to play the game and see if it was really all
            about satanic rituals and witchcraft. Luckily for my children I was unable to detect any evil and I have
            been running as the dungeon master at least one session of D&D a week for the past several years. If you
            want to learn more please click the D&D banner below.
