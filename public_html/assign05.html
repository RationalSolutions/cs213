        <h1>So many dice!</h1>
        <p>
            When it comes to playing Dungeons & Dragons, the only thing that you
            will need to purchase in order to play is a set of dice. This isn't
            your standard set of two cube dice that you are used to throwing
            when
            you are playing Monopoly or Risk, this set of 7 dice will help
            determine the fate of your character and the results of their
            actions. Each of these have a unique shape, name and are generally
            used for a wide variety of purposes in the game.
        </p>

                <p>
                    When you think of D&D and dice this is probably what most
                    people
                    think of. This is used when you want to know if something
                    you
                    tried to do was successful. You have a 5% chance to land on
                    a
                    "natural" 20 and score a critical hit!

                    D12 - Dodecahedron (12 sides)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is one of the least common used dice in D&D as it is
                    most
                    commonly used to roll damage on the largest weapons.

                    D10 - Pentagonal Trapezohedron (10 sides)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The set of D&D dice contains not one but TWO d10 dice. The
                    faces of
                    one are numbered 0 to 9, and the faces of the other go from
                    00 to
                    90 by tens. This is used for mainly for rolling damage but
                    using
                    the two together allows you to roll what is called a
                    percentile
                    roll. To make a 'percentile' roll, you roll both die and add
                    them
                    together, with one exception: a double zero roll is 100.

                    Often used to roll damage done by large weapons.

                <p>
                    Your common run of the mill die. This is used for everything
                    from
                    rolling the starting stats on your character to rolling the
                    damage from a wizards fireball.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is the one die that is more dangerous outside of the
                    game than
                    inside of the game, mainly because it is more violent to the
                    unprotected foot than legos ever were. Commonly used to
                    determine
                    the damage caused by small weapons.
